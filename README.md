# PyQt5-MusicPlayer_v1
Another episode of me practising pyqt5 with projects, this time I built a music player app. The main thing i tried learning in this app is navigation and passing data from screen to screen, overall speaking, I'm sattisfied about this project. I also  used my percentage calculator for creating responsive UI's that work on all screens :D !
