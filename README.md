# PyQt5-MusicPlayer_v1
Another episode of me practising pyqt5 with projects, this time I built a music player app. The main thing i tried learning in this app is navigation and passing data from screen to screen, overall speaking, I'm sattisfied about this project. I also  used my percentage calculator for creating responsive UI's that work on all screens :D !

# Note # 
there is a bug in the app which returns: pygame.error: set_pos unsupported for this codec 
I unfortunately couldn't solve the issue and as It's just a hobby project I decided I'd rather not waste my hours on this. Please dont mind!
